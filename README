This module uses Google Chrome's speech to text capabilities to provide voice
recognition for Xi.

Installation:

1) Install chrome-stt as a Chrome extension.
(Settings -> Load Unpacked Extension -> select chrome-stt directory)
2) Download jquery-2.1.0.min.js and put it inside the chrome-stt directory.
3) Go to Google Chrome Speech demo. Chrome will probably block the connection
between the extension and the chrome-stt server, because it's not https.
Search in the address bar for an icon that will let you allow this.
